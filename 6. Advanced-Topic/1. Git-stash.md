## STASH:

 - Stash can be applied for those files which have been not committed yet.
 - It allows you to save your work temporarily and revert the working directory to a clean state without committing changes
 - Suppose you're working on a project and have made some changes to a file but haven't committed them yet. Suddenly, you need to switch branches to address an urgent fix, but you don't want to commit your current changes. This is where git stash comes into play.

   ***git stash command***
   
- ```git stash``` (this will stash the file)
- ```git stash list``` (view list of stashes)
  
- now you can switch to another branch, and you can perform urgent fix.
- ```git stash apply``` (once you back by urgent task, this command will apply changes from most recent stash)
- ```git stash apply stash@{stash_number}```
- ```git stash drop/clear``` (when you done with stashed changes and donâ€™t need them anymore)
- ```git stash drop stash@{stash_number}```
