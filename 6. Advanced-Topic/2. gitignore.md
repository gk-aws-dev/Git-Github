## .gitignore :

- The .gitignore file is a configuration file used by Git to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It allows you to define files or patterns that you want Git to disregard, meaning these files won't be tracked or staged for commits.
  
- Ignoring unwanted file: It helps in avoiding accidentally committing files that are generated during the development process, such as log files, compiled binaries, or editor-specific temporary files.
Reducing conflict by preventing the user specific specific files.

-	Create the .gitignore file and specify the filename, file patterns and directory that we want to ignore in git as bellow.

```
# Ignore ALL .log files
*.log

# ignore ALL files in ANY directory named temp
temp/
#ignore the all files under build directory
/build/
```

- once you added the pattern in file, add and commit the file and then it will reflect.
  
- ```git status â€“-ignored``` (to check the status of ignored file)
  
(It is also possible to ignore files or folders but not show it in the distributed .gitignore file. These kinds of ignores are specified in the .git/info/exclude file. It works the same way as .gitignore but are not shown to anyone else.)
