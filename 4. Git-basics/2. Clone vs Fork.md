## CLONE vs FORK

- **Clone:** When you clone a repository, you get a complete copy of the entire project, including all branches, commit history, and files. Cloning is primarily used to start working on an existing project, allowing you to have your own local copy to make changes. 

- **Fork:** creates a copy of a repository within the same platform but under your user account.

```git clone <forked_repository_url>```

Forking on GitHub refers to making a copy of someone else's repository to your own account. This copy allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original repository. You can modify the code, add new features, fix bugs, or make any changes you desire.
