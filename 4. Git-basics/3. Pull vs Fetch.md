## Git Pull and Fetch:

- **Pull:** git pull copies changes from the remote repository directly into your working directory.
```git pull``` is a combination of ```git fetch``` and ```git merge```. It fetches the changes from the remote repository and automatically merges them into your current local branch.

- **Fetch:** only copies latest changes into your local Git repository but does not automatically merge or apply these changes to your local branch.
It updates the remote tracking branches (origin/master, origin/main, etc.) in your local repository, allowing you to see what has changed in the remote branches without affecting your working branch.
