# Source Code Management (SCM) and its benefits:

-	This ensures that developers are always working on the right version of source code.
-	Source control management (SCM) refers to tools that help you keep track of your code with a complete history of changes.
-	This is used to resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple developers.
-	**Traceability and Auditing:** It allows tracking who made which changes and when.
-	**Branching and Merging:** Developers can create branches to work on specific features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. And eventually they can merge as well.
-	**Collaboration:** SCM allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase concurrently.
-	**Version Control:** SCM systems like Git, Mercurial, or SVN track changes made to the source code. This enables developers to manage different versions of the codebase, 
  revert to previous versions if needed, and collaborate effectively in a team environment without overriding each other's work. compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.
