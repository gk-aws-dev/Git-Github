## GIT Branching:

**Types of Branches:**

**•	Main/Branch:**
- The main branch in Git repositories often has names like master or main.
- It represents the default development branch and typically reflects the most stable version of the project.

**•	Feature Branches:**
- Created for developing new features or working on specific tasks.
- Isolated from the main branch until the feature is complete and ready for integration.

**•	Release Branches:**
- Used for preparing and stabilizing code for a release.
- Isolated for final testing and bug fixes before deployment.

**•	Hotfix Branches:**
- Created to quickly address critical issues or bugs in production code.
- Fixes are made independently and merged into the main and release branches.
