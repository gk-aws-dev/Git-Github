## Git merge 
- Git merge will help to combine the changes from two or more branches into a single branch. Developers will work on different branches to improve code or to develop the code after completion we can merge them into a single version of the code


## 1. Merge: 
- Creates a new merge commit, maintaining the original branch history.

```git merge dev``` (execute from the master branch)

-	Merge preserves the commit history of each feature branch.
-	It retains a clear indication of when each feature was integrated into the shared branch.

## 2. Rebase: 
- Moves the entire feature branch to start from the tip of main, rewriting the commit history.
  
```git rebase dev```

-	integrate changes from one branch onto another by rewriting commit history.
-	It rewrites your commit history by placing your changes on top of the updated main branch, avoiding unnecessary merge commits.
-	Results in a cleaner, linear history on your feature branch before merging into the main branch.


***main difference between the git merge and git rebase***

-	Use merge for shared/public branches to preserve history.
-	Use rebase for private/local branches to maintain a cleaner, linear history.
